This is a program that can convert 5.1 or 7.1 audio signals to a dowmixed stereo signal that can be decode by old matrix surround sound receivers.

*This program requieres the portaudio version modified by the audacity team, since it uses the wasapi loopback to extract the audio. **It also uses wxwidgets to provide a graphical interface.
*The modified portaudio Librery is included.
*The Audio Glitching in Windows 10 starting in update 2004 has been corrected.
